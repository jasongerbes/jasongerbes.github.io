heading: "A bit about me"
---
<p>Born in the always-sunny Hawke's Bay of New Zealand, I moved to Auckland to pursue my passion for technology, design and sustainability.</p>
<p>Since graduating from Auckland University of Technology with a Bachelor of Computer Science, I have worked with a number of high profile New Zealand companies.</p>
<p>I'm always looking to work on the next big thing and draw inspiration from Apple, Vend, Tesla, SpaceX and Dyson.</p>
